## Hypothesis Statement

> This is a strong hypothesis statement to start with.

> The statement is subject to change as we go further into our research and analysis.  

*We believe that there was a net population shift from the central business district of
Liverpool, Parramatta and Sydney to greater suburbs and regional areas of the aforementioned metropolises through the Alpha to Delta outbreaks. The number of localities
considered for visualisations roughly stands at 4,000 of the so-called ‘statistical areas’(SA2’s) by the Australian Bureau of Statistics across the entire state 
for the 2007 – 2015 and 2019 – 2021 Census data.*

*As a result, he various social and economic implications of these intrastate movements,
both short-term and long-term, are of this study’s interest.*
