## Goals

[Main Page](https://github.com/Artixis/Maths_Project/blob/main/README.md)

 ### Github set up
- [x] Organise notes/literature
- [x] Run and compile code (pull/push/commit) both of us.

<br/><br/>

### Code 

> Possibly look at one data set each?

- [ ] Map distance using the shape files.
- [ ] Investigate and really understand mixed effect models.
- [ ] ^ Do the same with geographically weighted regression
- [ ] Start research into how to geographically visualize data with lat/long values.


<br/><br/>

### Presentation

> Obviously this isn't urgent right now

- [ ] Design slides nicely. Think of user ease when reading/engaing.
- [ ] What needs to/can be taught in 20 mins? Choose carefully.
- [ ] Allocate sections to each speaker.
- [ ] Practise (Once all else is done)

<br/><br/>

### Final Report 

- [ ] Spell check carefully
- [ ] Get Russell and others to read through before submitting 
- [ ] Clearly indicate who wrote each part
- [ ] Again, focus on key points (Although we are albe to say more in the report)
- [ ] Check final PDF after compiling for any mistakes
