## Goals

[Main Page](https://github.com/Artixis/Maths_Project/blob/main/README.md)

 ### Github set up
- [x] Organise notes/literature
- [x] Run and compile code (pull/push/commit) both of us.

<br/><br/>

### Code 

> Possibly look at one data set each?

- [ ] Map distance using the shape files.
- [ ] Investigate and really understand mixed effect models.
- [ ] ^ Do the same with geographically weighted regression
- [ ] Start research into how to geographically visualize data with lat/long values.


<br/><br/>

### Presentation

> Obviously this isn't urgent right now

- [ ] Design slides nicely. Think of user ease when reading/engaing.
- [ ] What needs to/can be taught in 20 mins? Choose carefully.
- [ ] Allocate sections to each speaker.
- [ ] Practise (Once all else is done)

<br/><br/>

### Final Report 

- [ ] Spell check carefully
- [ ] Get Russell and others to read through before submitting 
- [ ] Clearly indicate who wrote each part
- [ ] Again, focus on key points (Although we are albe to say more in the report)
- [ ] Check final PDF after compiling for any mistakes

## Tasks and Timeline
### Week 10: Understand Mixed-Effects model
Laura to:
-	Work on Density and send it over to My
My to:
-	Takes care of Mixed-effects code
-	Interactive term to be passed onto Laura
Both to:
-	Understand the Maths of Mixed-Effects model ïƒ  formulate with LaTeX later on
-	Research for more miteratures on mixed-effects model: accuracy, precision, etc.
	- Further notes: Russell passed/failed model in R?

### Week 11: Questions about Mixed-effects for Russell. Writing and Reading. <br>
Laura is emailing Russell with:
- R script with 2020 and 2021 terms in the model
- Clarify transformation with math explanation
- "Perfect" model with significant p-values
My:
- Get math from research on Mixed-Effects model
- Prepare LaTeX with proper structures and a few math formulas <br>

### Week 12: Start writing (latest) 
### Week 13: Progress
### Week 14: Friday 28 October - 11:59pm
	- Russell will be in Sydney Monday 24 October!
### Week 15: STUVAC
### Week 16: Presentation on Tuesday! (7 November)
