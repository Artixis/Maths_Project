## Methodology For Project

[Main Page](https://github.com/Artixis/Maths_Project/blob/main/README.md)

> Methodology is split into four categories. Obviously there will be some overlap between the four. However
> the idea behind seperating them, is to go into greater detail for each individual part.
> 
> The categories are relatively chronological, in that our report will follow as similar layout.
