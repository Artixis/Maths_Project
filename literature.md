### **1** Migration Between Cities and Chapters: *A quick guide to COVID-19 impacts.* 
#### Note 1
- There is a net shift in migration away from capital cities to regional areas in
2020-21, before gradually returning towards the long-run average (of migration).

#### Note 2
- Underscoring the uncertainty surrounding this topic, surveyed experts
were split on the impact of COVID-19: Â½ believe there is no difference,
the rest do.
- Early PRIME (Provisional Regional Internal Migration Estimates) data
indicates there has been a net shift in migration towards regional areas.
- The impact of the lockdown in Melbourne and Victoria is also evident in
these data, with Melbourne experiencing its largest net migration loss on
record.

#### Note 3
- COVID-19 is expected to result in less migration to capital cities, at least in
the short to medium-term.

#### Note 4
##### Reason for moving
Relocating/Moving between cities and regions is closely related to:
- Age: Movers are mainly young adults.
- Key life events: educational opportunities, entry into the labour market,
forming relationships.
- Further: Family-lifestyle considerations, and relative access to jobs and
house prices.
