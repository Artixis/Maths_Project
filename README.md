# Impacts of the COVID pandemic on regional internal migration.

*The project will involve downloading regional internal migration estimates from the ABS in 2021 and 2019
in regions around Sydney. Regression Models will be fit to looking at associations between migration and
distance from population centres, income, distance to beaches, etc. The project should incorporate some data
visualisation.*
