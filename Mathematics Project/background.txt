Background draft
****************

Our problem focuses on investigating any possible changes to intrastate 
migration in NSW since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**
Information from preliminary literature reviews
**

The topic is not necessarily original but we hope our approach and 
use of newer data will add to the conversation. The literature looks at
interstate migration, understandably, given that boarder restrictions 
we enforced during the first 1-2 years of the pandemic. 

We would like to look at intrastate migration. Has the pandemic affected 
this? 
If so, can we infer why? 
Specifically we want to see if there are more people leaving Sydney and
other highly populated cities in NSW (Parramatta, Liverpool)

Our other primary motivation behind this project is to utilize appropiate
statistical methods with our avaliable data.
